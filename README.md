## Inspiration
 A video game where the player controls a vehicle in a real-world or fantasy environment or track.
 
## What it does
A player is racing in the game Project CARS against other players. To control a car or another vehicle on a computer, the player may use a keyboard and shift right,left,up and down.



##  How We built it
Frontend: > HTML,CSS,Javascript.<br>


## Challenges I ran into
To make car move left, right, up and down and at the same time car shouldn't vanish out from the frame.<br>
Stop the game at the time of collision. 


## Accomplishments that We're proud of
We were successfully able to implement all the features that we have thought of .


## What's next for Car racing Game!
